//Q1. A school conducts three exams namely term 1 exams,term 2 exams and 
//final term exams. Final marks scored(weighted marks) are computed as 
//30% of term1 and term2 eachâ€™s marks + 40% of the final term marks. 
//Write a program to compute the weighted marks for a student who 
//cored 412 in first term, 423 in second term and 430 in third term. 
//Then compute the weighted percentage out of 500 marks.
//Use appropriate constructor functions.
